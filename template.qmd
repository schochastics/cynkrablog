This paragraph will be the lead paragraph. Do not add more than one paragraph in this block.

To get started, add a lead paragraph above and delete the help text below. Happy blogging

# Correct Heading

The blogs maximal header is not allowed to be `#` or `###` and should always start with `##`. 
A filter makes sure this is the case.

# Image alt

A filter produces correct alt tags for images in gfm format for the cynkra blog.
Currently, quarto turns `fig-alt = "Alt text"` into `data-fig-alt` instead of just `alt`.

![](https://placecats.com/300/200){fig-alt='A placeholder image' width=300 height=200}

```{r}
#| label: test1
#| fig-alt: testing
plot(1:10)
```

# Image class

Currently, there is also a filter that adds `class="tw:lg:w-[70%]" loading="lazy"`
to all images for better performances. This needs to be reevaluated


# Code fold
If you want to make a code block collapsible, add the shortcode `{{< code-fold >}}` in front of a code chunk.

{{< code-fold >}}
```{r}
#| label: test2
x <- 2 - 1
# test
```

# og_image

Dont forget to add a "cover image" for your post.
